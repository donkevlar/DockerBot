# DockerBot
Simple DockerBot

Can Start, Stop, Restart and List all currently running containers. 

Can use remote connections. 

Note: This was created more as an experiment, please use at your own risk. If you want to look at my more fleshed out project, please check out [Bookshelf-Traveller](https://github.com/donkevlar/Bookshelf-Traveller)
